    "# Collect Data\n",
    "To obtain data, a recipe is parsed to identify dictionary matches. Each dictionary entry corresponds to an index in recipe space. So, each recipe is represented as a vector in recipe space of dimension 4060. Beginnning with a set of 15768 recipe vectors. 10% of those vectors, at equal intervals are reserved as test data. The result should be 4 matrices, trainX representing 14191 recipe vectors, trainY representing binary labels for each of those recipes, testX representing 1577 recipe vectors on which to test, and testY reresenting labels for the test data. For the label matrices, a 1 in column 0 represents 'dinner', while a 1 in column 1 represents 'non-dinner'."
